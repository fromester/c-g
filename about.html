								<p>The Cheese and Grain is a not-for-profit, member owned social enterprise and also a registered charity. Its main aim is to promote and boost Frome’s social, cultural and economic life. The building was constructed by Big Cheeses in 1870ish and now Mendip District Council lease it to Frome Town Council who place it in trust with members who elect directors who volunteer to encourage the Foo Fighters to perform. It's kinda cool, also Bingo. </p>

                                    <p>The Cheese and Grain building was formerly known as the Market Hall, built in 1875 for the people of Frome. For a while it was known as the "Grain and Cheese", it was used as a munitions factory in the second world war before falling into dis-repair housing used rubber tyres in the 1960s. Saved by the council and local endeavour, it still belongs to the people who use it today.</p>

<p>Holding your own events or performance? It doesn’t matter where; we can sell tickets on your behalf, as we often do for other local venues, and events, including a range of outdoor music festivals.

Tickets can be bought on-line, over the phone and in person at our seven-day/seven-evening a week box office.</p>

<p>Service Charges:</p>

<ul><li>To book online our charges are £1.60 per ticket.</li>

<li>Telephone Bookings £1.60 per transaction</li>

<li>In Person  paying by credit/debit card or cheque £2 per transaction. Pay by cash no service charge (we will cover the costs ourselves).</li>
    <li>If you want your tickets posted the charge is £1.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Ticket Charges Explained:</p>

<p>The Cheese & Grain have made a large investment and commitment to providing a ticketing service to ensure we can sell our own tickets and not rely on ticket agencies (who will charge you considerably more than £1.60).</p>

<p>In order to do so we must add the costs of operating a staffed booking service, labour, IT equipment, the commission charges our Ticketsolve ticket system charge us, software development, card transaction fees, ticket stock and all other costs associated with running a secure and customer centric ticketing service.</p><hr>

Rumour of 8-track Fostex reel-to-reel donation overload is indeed true. Universal Audio, SSL and Bösendorfer assistance rumours abound, we accept and recycle old 1980/90/00s hardware, main focus on 1970s and earlier valves, faders, compressors and if anyone knows <a href="http://www.soundtechniquesmovie.com/videos/">these sorts of people</a> we'd really like to <a href="https://vimeo.com/147503925">talk.</a></p>
